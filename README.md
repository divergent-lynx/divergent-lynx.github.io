##postinternet

“postinternet project” is a soft attempt at brain emulation or mind uploading. 
 
•	Hard brain emulation would entail entirely scanning/uploading a brain into a useful digital form. 
•	Soft brain emulation merely translates aspects of a cognitive module into a useful digital form. 
 
Say music is a cognitive module. In soft brain emulation, we take some aspect of music cognition (e.g., musical preference) and translate it into a digital form. This is the underlying utility of possessing a user profile on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. The real magic comes from how these services mirror cognition. Functional user profiles allow for custom groupings (e.g., playlists) that mirror the natural human tendency to cluster concepts according to personal preferences.
From the music-specific soft brain emulation model above, we can extrapolate to a more general framework:
 
Concepts are an emergent property based on an individual’s cognitive preferences. 
From here, we can derive a model for postinternet project as a personal attempt to translate ideas into concepts:
